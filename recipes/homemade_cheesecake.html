  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is literally the best cheesecake recipe ever. Seven simple ingredients. No water bath. No cracking ever. It is the
    only recipe you’ll ever need for classic, jaw-dropping, super creamy cheesecake. Follow my directions and it is simply
    fail-proof!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Graham Cracker Crumbs:</strong> Honeymaid is my favorite, but any brand is fine. You can grind your own or buy them as crumbs.</li>
     <li><strong>Granulated Sugar:</strong> to sweeten the crust and the filling.</li>
     <li><strong>Melted Butter:</strong> to hold the graham cracker crust together.</li>
     <li><strong>Cream Cheese:</strong> I like using the Philadelphia brand; I think it’s slightly tangier than other off-brands out there. Make sure you are using room temperature, soft cream cheese.</li>
     <li><strong>Sour Cream:</strong> adds an extra tang. This also needs to be at room temperature.</li>
     <li><strong>Vanilla Extract:</strong> for flavor since this is a classic cheesecake.</li>
     <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> needed for structure. Absolutely have these at room temperature and beat together before adding in.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
     <li><strong>Make the Graham Cracker Crust</strong></li>
       <p>Stir graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter together and press into a 9-inch springform pan. Bake for 7 minutes
       in a 350-degree oven. Set aside to cool.</p>
     <li><strong>Make the Cheesecake Filling</strong>
       <p>Stir very soft cream cheese together with the granulated sugar. Stir in the vanilla and sour cream. Scrape the sides
       really really well and stir again to ensure there are no lumps.</p>
       <p><strong>Whisk eggs together in a separate bowl</strong>and slowly add to the cheesecake filling with the mixer on. Once eggs are incorporated turn mixer off. Scrape the sides really well to ensure a very smooth batter. If there are lumps, stir them in by hand.</p></li>
     <li><strong>Remove Air Bubbles</strong></li>
       <p><strong>Tap bowl on the counter for 30-45 seconds</strong>to remove air bubbles. Air bubbles can contribute to why cheesecakes crack and we definitely want to prevent that. This is a small step, but makes a big difference.</p>
